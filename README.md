FlipperZero Brute for of LRS Pager System

# Just realized the generation for these files are broken. i will update and fix them tomorrow. Please do not use until then. Thanks

This should brute force all resturaunt IDs and pager ids and alert/beep each one three times.

I broke the captures up into 10 files so that single file isn't too big memory wise for the flipper-zero.
